Currently working on these two sites which I frequent the most:
- [National Post](http://www.nationalpost.com/index.html)
- [Toronto Star](http://www.thestar.com)

I would be happy to add *any* other one that you come across, just leave a comment/open an issue/[tweet me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=dave_lunny&screen_name=dave_lunny&share_with_retweet=never&tw_p=tweetbutton)
